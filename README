pep-talk is a quote-file with pep talk quotes from Halls cough drops
wrappers. It can be used with the Unix Fortune program.

If anything is incorrect or missing or there is any problem with
these being offered here, please let me know.

Though the .dat file is provided, you are welcome to generate it on
your own if fortune is installed by using:

    strfile pep-talk

Then copy pep-talk and pep-talk.dat to the directory containing the
fortunes and get a random fortune using:

    fortune pep-talk

Collected and transcribed from various sources by Gary S. Weaver.
Credit to the quotes themselves should be given to their original
author(s).
